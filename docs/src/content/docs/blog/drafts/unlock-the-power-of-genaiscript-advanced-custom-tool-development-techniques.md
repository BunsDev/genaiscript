# "Unlock the Power of GenAIScript: Advanced Custom Tool Development Techniques"

Welcome to another deep dive into the fascinating world of GenAIScript! 🎉 Today, we are going to explore advanced techniques for custom tool development that will take your GenAIScript workflows to the next level. Buckle up, as this guide will arm you with the knowledge to create robust tools, integrate them seamlessly, and optimize your scripts for enhanced performance and functionality.

## 🛠️ Defining Custom Tools

### 1. Fetching Weather Information

```js
defTool(
    "current_weather",
    "Fetch the current weather information for a given location",
    {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            location: {
                type: "string",
                description: "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
            },
        },
        required: ["location"],
    },
    (args) => {
        const { location } = args;
        // Simulate fetching weather data
        if (location === "San Francisco, CA") return "sunny";
        else return "variable";
    }
);
```

Here, we define a tool named `current_weather` to fetch weather information. The tool expects an object with a `location` property as input and returns a string indicating the weather.

### 2. Performing Complex Math Operations

```js
defTool(
    "complex_math",
    "Perform complex math operations",
    {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            expression: {
                type: "string",
                description: "A math expression to evaluate, e.g. (2+2)*2",
            },
        },
        required: ["expression"],
    },
    (args) => {
        const { expression } = args;
        // Simple math expression evaluator
        try {
            return eval(expression);
        } catch (e) {
            return "error";
        }
    }
);
```

The `complex_math` tool evaluates mathematical expressions. It takes an `expression` as a string, evaluates it using `eval`, and returns the result.

### 3. Searching Documents

```js
defTool(
    "document_search",
    "Search for a specific term in documents",
    {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            term: {
                type: "string",
                description: "The term to search for in documents",
            },
            documents: {
                type: "array",
                items: {
                    type: "string",
                },
                description: "An array of document contents to search within",
            },
        },
        required: ["term", "documents"],
    },
    (args) => {
        const { term, documents } = args;
        // Simple search implementation
        return documents.map((doc, index) => ({
            document: index,
            occurrences: (doc.match(new RegExp(term, "g")) || []).length,
        }));
    }
);
```

The `document_search` tool searches for a term within an array of documents. It returns an array indicating the number of occurrences of the term in each document.

## 🧩 Putting It All Together

```js
script({
    title: "Advanced Techniques for Custom Tool Development",
    tools: ["current_weather", "complex_math", "document_search"],
});
```

Here, we define a script that uses our custom tools. The `tools` array includes the names of the tools we defined earlier.

### Example Usage of Tools

```js
const exampleDocuments = [
    "This is a sample document containing various terms and phrases.",
    "Another document with different content and different terms.",
];

$`Use the document_search tool to find occurrences of the term 'document' in the example documents.

Use the current_weather tool to get the weather for 'San Francisco, CA'.

Use the complex_math tool to evaluate the expression '(2+3)*5'.

Provide the results in a structured format.`
```

In this segment, we invoke our tools using a script. This script:
1. Searches for the term "document" in `exampleDocuments` using `document_search`.
2. Fetches the weather for "San Francisco, CA" using `current_weather`.
3. Evaluates the expression `(2+3)*5` using `complex_math`.

## 📚 Documentation and Examples

For more detailed information on defining and using tools, check out the [GenAIScript tools documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools).

### Tool Agent Example

```js
defTool(
    "sum",
    "Sum two numbers",
    {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            a: {
                type: "number",
                description: "The first number",
            },
            b: {
                type: "number",
                description: "The second number",
            },
        },
        required: ["a", "b"],
    },
    ({ a, b }) => `${a + b}`
);
```

In this example, we define a simple tool named `sum` to sum two numbers. For more on tool agents, check out the [Tool Agent Guide](docs/src/content/docs/guides/tool-agent.mdx).
